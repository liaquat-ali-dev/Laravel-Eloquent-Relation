## Laravel Eloquent Relations Documentation

## Introduction


Laravel's Eloquent ORM facilitates the definition and management of relationships between database tables. These relationships simplify data retrieval and manipulation, enhancing code readability and maintainability. There are three primary types of relationships supported by Eloquent:

- One-to-One.
- One-to-Many.
- Many-to-Many.

This documentation provides an overview of each relationship type, including definitions, use cases, and best practices.

## One-to-One Relationship

## Definition

In a one-to-one relationship, each record in one table is associated with exactly one record in another table.

## Use Cases

- Each car has exactly one registration.
- Each registration belongs to only one car.

## Best Practices

- Utilize when a strict one-to-one correspondence exists between entities.
- Use when data normalization is required to reduce redundancy.


## One-to-Many Relationship

## Definition

A one-to-many relationship signifies that each record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.

## Use Cases

- An author can have multiple books.
- Each book is authored by a single author.

## Use Cases

- Apply when one entity can have multiple related instances.
-   Suitable for hierarchical data structures where a parent entity manages subordinate entities.
